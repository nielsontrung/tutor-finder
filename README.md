## Executive Summary
Tutor Finder is an innovative mobile application created to match university students with peer tutors quickly, and with as little barrier to entry as possible.
 
## Introduction
Tutor Finder is a mobile application created to match university students with peer tutors for tutoring sessions located on their university campus. The focus of the application is to maximize the speed and ease of matching, while still guaranteeing the quality of the user interaction. The application assists users in seeking help with their studies, and allows them to build a network of peers at their university who wish to tutor and/or be tutored.
 
## Design Problem
At its core, the design problem Tutor Finder addresses is one of matching students and tutors quickly while still guaranteeing the competence of the tutors, however they are difficult to use and lack efficiency in their matching systems. Existing systems do not incentivize tutors to respond to student's requests for tutoring in a timely manner, as well, these systems do not guarantee that students and tutors will be located relatively close to one another. Many of these existing applications do not include a review system, warn others of their negative experience.
 
Tutor Finder addresses these problems by placing a time limit on student requests for tutoring, and rewarding tutors for responding quickly. Tutors looking for students to utor can view a map of students near them on their campus, ensuring users are always located conveniently for one another. As well, Tutor Finder implements a star-based, and written review system so students can assess the quality of their tutoring experience and display that assessment publicly. These systems ensure that users are matched together efficiently while still maintaining high quality.
 
## Conclusions
The initial problem we sought to solve with Tutor FInder was how to match students and tutors in an easy and efficient manner while still guaranteeing a positive user experience. Through internal deliberation and market research, we were able to identify designs and features that set Tutor Finder apart from its competitors. Using an iterative design process, starting with the lowest of low-fidelity prototypes and working up to the current high-fidelity prototype, we were able to distill the designs and functionalities of Tutor Finder down to an intuitive, and visually appealing mobile application. We believe that Tutor Finder is the solution to the problem we initially identified.
